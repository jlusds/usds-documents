# USDS 3.0 - Feedback Template

## Summary
1-3 sentence summary of the what and why of your ask(s)

Example
“USDS 3.0 should issue USDS branded socks to all employees. This would greatly help with employee burnout and create a stronger sense of community and purpose.”

## Observations + Challenges
Supporting context for why you’re making the ask. Include personal experiences, observations, industry best practices, etc.

Example
During the last 12 months of remote work, socks wearing has increased significantly which has increased to overuse of socks. The average USDS employee currently spends 40 minutes in the morning trying to find clean socks without holes.
